# Titanic SpaceShip Competition

## Overview
This repository contains code and analysis for the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal of the competition is to predict whether passengers survive the spaceship journey.

## Setup
This project utilizes various libraries including TensorFlow, TensorFlow Decision Forests, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Ensure these are installed in your environment before running the code.

## Contents
- **Spaceship_Titanic_Notebook.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and submission.
- **README.md**: This README file.

## Instructions
To reproduce the analysis and submission:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `Spaceship_Titanic_Notebook.ipynb`. This notebook contains step-by-step instructions for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and submission.
4. Ensure all required libraries are installed in your environment.
5. After running the notebook, the submission file will be generated in the `/output` directory.

## Notes
- The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, model training using TensorFlow Decision Forests, evaluation, and submission.
- Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy are provided.
- The submission file is generated following the Kaggle competition requirements.
